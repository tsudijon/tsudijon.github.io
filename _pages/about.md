# About Me.

I am a 4th Year Ph.D student in Statistics at Stanford. I'm advised by [Sourav Chatterjee](https://souravchatterjee.su.domains//) and I work closely with [Lihua Lei](https://lihualei71.github.io/index.html). My research interests center around neural networks, causal inference, and experimentation. I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I worked in quantitative finance. Before that, I studied Applied Mathematics at Brown University, where I had the pleasure of working with [Kavita Ramanan](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/faculty/kavita-ramanan/home) and [Lorin Crawford](https://www.lorincrawford.com/). I can be contacted at tsudijon at stanford.edu.
